## cpprestsdk (C++ REST SDK)
Developed by Microsoft, this library provides a simple API for HTTP client and 
server communication, JSON parsing, and OAuth. It's designed for cloud-based 
client-server communication.

### Dependencies 
* Boost
  * Boost.System
  * Boost.Chrono
  * Boost.Thread
  * Boost.DateTime.
* OpenSSL (for HTTPS)
* optionally WebSocket++ for WebSocket support.
``
## cpp-httplib
A lightweight, single-header HTTP/HTTPS server and client library. It supports 
SSL via OpenSSL or mbedTLS and is easy to integrate due to its header-only nature.

### Dependencies 
OpenSSL or mbedTLS for SSL support; however, it's dependency-free if SSL is not 
required.

## Pistache
A high-performance REST toolkit written in C++14, suitable for creating both 
HTTP client and server applications. It emphasizes speed and scalability.

### Dependencies: 
Requires a C++14 compliant compiler; uses the CMake build system. Boost::asio

## POCO C++ Libraries
A comprehensive collection of C++ class libraries aimed at simplifying 
network-centric application development. It offers modules for networking, file 
system access, and more.

### Dependencies: 
Depending on the modules used, it may require OpenSSL (for NetSSL), zlib 
(for compression), and other standard libraries.

## nghttp2
An implementation of HTTP/2 and its header compression algorithm HPACK. It 
includes an HTTP/2 client, server, and proxy, along with a library for building 
HTTP/2 applications.

### Dependencies:
OpenSSL or GnuTLS for SSL/TLS support; 
zlib for header compression.

## CppCMS
A C++ web framework focused on performance, aimed at developing dynamic web 
applications. It provides tools for template management, caching, and more.

### Dependencies: 

* Boost libraries
  *  Boost.System
  * Boost.Filesystem
  * Boost.Thread.
* zlib 
* optionally OpenSSL for HTTPS support.

## restclient-cpp
A simple HTTP client for C++, designed for making HTTP requests with a 
straightforward interface.

### Dependencies: 
libcurl for handling HTTP requests.

## restc-cpp
A modern C++ REST client library designed for ease of use and efficiency. It 
supports synchronous and asynchronous operations.

### Dependencies 
Boost.Asio and libcurl.

## TinyAPI
Description: A minimalistic C++11 HTTP server library designed for embedding in applications. It focuses on simplicity and ease of integration.
### Dependencies: No external dependencies; it's a header-only library.
